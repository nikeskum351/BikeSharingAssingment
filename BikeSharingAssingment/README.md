## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
- The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. 
- So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- The company wants to know: 1) Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
                             2) How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Technologies Used
- numpy
- pandas, matplotlib
- sklearn, statsmodels

## Conclusions
- I have build multiple modesl, but model7 is the final one with significant co-effiecents
- temp has highest co-relation with the dependent variable bike booking count
- year variable Significantly  contributes the demand of bike. 
- Clear weather (Light_Rain_Snow + Mist_Cloudy) attracts the customer.
